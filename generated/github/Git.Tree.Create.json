If you specify both a tree and a nested path modifying that tree, this endpoint will overwrite the contents of the tree with the new path contents, and create a new tree structure.\n\nIf you use this endpoint to add, delete, or modify the file contents in a tree, you will need to commit the tree and then update a branch to point to the commit. For more information see \"[Create a commit](https://docs.github.com/rest/git/commits#create-a-commit)\" and \"[Update a reference](https://docs.github.com/rest/git/refs#update-a-reference).\"\n\nReturns an error if you try to delete a file that does not exist.",
