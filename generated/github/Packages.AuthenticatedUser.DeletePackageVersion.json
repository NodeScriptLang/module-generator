If the package is public and the package version has more than 5,000 downloads, you cannot delete the package version. In this scenario, contact GitHub support for further assistance.\n\nThe authenticated user must have admin permissions in the organization to use this endpoint.\n\nOAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `read:packages` and `delete:packages` scopes to use this endpoint.
