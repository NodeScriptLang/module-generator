You won't be able to push to the old branch name while the rename process is in progress. For more information, see \"[Renaming a branch](https://docs.github.com/github/administering-a-repository/renaming-a-branch)\".\n\nThe authenticated user must have push access to the branch. If the branch is the default branch, the authenticated user must also have admin or owner permissions.\n\nIn order to rename the default branch, fine-grained access tokens also need the `administration:write` repository permission.",
