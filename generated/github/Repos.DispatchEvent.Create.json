  "description": "You can use this endpoint to trigger a webhook event called `repository_dispatch` when you want activity that happens outside of GitHub to trigger a GitHub Actions workflow or GitHub App webhook. You must configure your GitHub Actions workflow or GitHub App to run when the `repository_dispatch` event occurs. For an example `repository_dispatch` webhook payload, see \"[RepositoryDispatchEvent](https://docs.github.com/webhooks/event-payloads/#repository_dispatch).\"\n\nThe `client_payload` parameter is available for any extra information that your workflow might need. This parameter is a JSON payload that will be passed on when the webhook event is dispatched. For example, the `client_payload` can include a message that a user would like to send using a GitHub Actions workflow. Or the `client_payload` can be used as a test to debug your workflow.\n\nThis input example shows how you can use the `client_payload` as a test to debug your workflow.\n\nOAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint.",
