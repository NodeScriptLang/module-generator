  "description": "Searches for query terms inside of a file. This method returns up to 100 results [per page](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api).\n\nWhen searching for code, you can get text match metadata for the file **content** and file **path** fields when you pass the `text-match` media type. For more details about how to receive highlighted search results, see [Text match metadata](https://docs.github.com/rest/search/search#text-match-metadata).\n\nFor example, if you want to find the definition of the `addClass` function inside [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) repository, your query would look something like this:\n\n`q=addClass+in:file+language:js+repo:jquery/jquery`\n\nThis query searches for the keyword `addClass` within a file's contents. The query limits the search to files where the language is JavaScript in the `jquery/jquery` repository.\n\nConsiderations for code search:\n\nDue to the complexity of searching code, there are a few restrictions on how searches are performed:\n\n*   Only the _default branch_ is considered. In most cases, this will be the `master` branch.\n*   Only files smaller than 384 KB are searchable.\n*   You must always include at least one search term when searching source code. For example, searching for [`language:go`](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=language%3Ago&type=Code) is not valid, while [`amazing\nlanguage:go`](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=amazing+language%3Ago&type=Code) is.\n\nThis endpoint requires you to authenticate and limits you to 10 requests per minute.",
