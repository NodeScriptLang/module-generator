See \"[Searching topics](https://docs.github.com/articles/searching-topics/)\" for a detailed list of qualifiers.\n\nWhen searching for topics, you can get text match metadata for the topic's **short\\_description**, **description**, **name**, or **display\\_name** field when you pass the `text-match` media type. For more details about how to receive highlighted search results, see [Text match metadata](https://docs.github.com/rest/search/search#text-match-metadata).\n\nFor example, if you want to search for topics related to Ruby that are featured on https://github.com/topics. Your query might look like this:\n\n`q=ruby+is:featured`\n\nThis query searches for topics with the keyword `ruby` and limits the results to find only topics that are featured. The topics that are the best match for the query appear first in the search results.",
