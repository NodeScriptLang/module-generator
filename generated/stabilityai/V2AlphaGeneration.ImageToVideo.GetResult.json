  "description": "Fetch the result of an image-to-video generation by ID. Make sure you use the same API key that you used to\ngenerate the video, otherwise you will receive a `404` response.\n\n### How is progress reported?\nYour generation is either `in-progress` (i.e. status code `202`) or it is complete (i.e. status code `200`). \nWe may add more fine-grained progress reporting in the future (e.g. a numerical progress).\n\n### How long are results stored?\nResults are stored for 24 hours after generation. After that, the results are deleted and you will need to \nre-generate your video.",
