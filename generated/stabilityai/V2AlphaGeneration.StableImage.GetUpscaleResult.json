  "description": "Fetch the result of an upscale generation by ID. Make sure to use the same API key to fetch the generation result\nthat you used to create the generation, otherwise you will receive a `404` response.\n\n### How is progress reported?\nYour generation is either `in-progress` (i.e. status code `202`) or it is complete (i.e. status code `200`). \nWe may add more fine-grained progress reporting in the future (e.g. a numerical progress).\n\n### How long are results stored?\nResults are stored for 24 hours after generation. After that, the results are deleted.",
