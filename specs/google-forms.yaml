      create an empty form with a title and (optional) document title, and then
      call forms.update to add the items.

          should be treated opaquely. A returned revision ID is only guaranteed
          to be valid for 24 hours after it has been returned and cannot be
          shared across users. If the revision ID is unchanged between calls,
          then the form has not changed. Conversely, a changed ID (for the same
          form and user) usually means the form has been updated; however, a
          changed ID can also be due to internal factors such as ID format
          changes.
