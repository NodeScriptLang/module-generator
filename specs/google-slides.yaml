          access to the presentation. The revision ID is not a sequential number
          but a nebulous string. The format of the revision ID may change over
          time, so it should be treated opaquely. A returned revision ID is only
          guaranteed to be valid for 24 hours after it has been returned and
          cannot be shared across users. If the revision ID is unchanged between
          calls, then the presentation has not changed. Conversely, a changed ID
          (for the same presentation and user) usually means the presentation
          has been updated. However, a changed ID can also be due to internal
          factors such as ID format changes.

      replies to give you some information about how they are applied. Other
      requests do not need to return information; these each return an empty
      reply. The order of replies matches that of the requests. For example,
      suppose you call batchUpdate with four updates, and only the third one
      returns information. The response would have two empty replies: the reply
      to the third request, and another empty reply, in that order. Because
      other users may be editing the presentation, the presentation might not
      exactly reflect your changes: your changes may be altered with respect to
      collaborator changes. If there are no collaborators, the presentation
      should reflect your changes. In any case, the updates in your request are
