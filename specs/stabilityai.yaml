  Welcome to the Stability Platform API. As of March 2024, we are building the
  REST v2beta API service to be the primary API service for the Stability
  Platform. 

  All AI services on other APIs (gRPC, REST v1, RESTv2alpha) will continue to be
  maintained, however they will not receive

  new features or parameters.


  If you are a REST v2alpha user, we strongly recommend that you adjust the URL
  calls for the specific services that you are using over to the equivalent REST
  v2beta URL. Normally, this means simply replacing "v2alpha" with "v2beta". We
  are not deprecating v2alpha URLs at this time for users that are currently
  using them.


  #### Authentication


  You will need your [Stability API
  key](https://platform.stability.ai/account/keys) in order to make requests to
  this API.

  Make sure you never share your API key with anyone, and you never commit it to
  a public repository. Include this key in 

  the `Authorization` header of your requests.


  #### Rate limiting


  This API is rate-limited to 150 requests every 10 seconds. If you exceed this
  limit, you will receive a `429` response

  and be timed out for 60 seconds. If you find this limit too restrictive,
  please reach out to us via [this
  form](https://stabilityplatform.freshdesk.com/support/home).


  #### Support


  Please see our [FAQ](https://platform.stability.ai/faq) for answers to common
  questions. If you have any other questions or concerns,

  please reach out to us via [this
  form](https://stabilityplatform.freshdesk.com/support/tickets/new).


  To see the health of our APIs, please check our [Status

modules:
  - moduleName: V2Alpha Generation / Image To Video / Get Result

    description: >-
      Fetch the result of an image-to-video generation by ID. Make sure you use
      the same API key that you used to

      generate the video, otherwise you will receive a `404` response.


      ### How is progress reported?

      Your generation is either `in-progress` (i.e. status code `202`) or it is
      complete (i.e. status code `200`). 

      We may add more fine-grained progress reporting in the future (e.g. a
      numerical progress).


      ### How long are results stored?

      Results are stored for 24 hours after generation. After that, the results
      are deleted and you will need to 

      re-generate your video.

      ### Using SDXL 1.0

      Use `stable-diffusion-xl-1024-v1-0` as the `engine_id` of your request and
      pass in `height` & `width` as one of the following combinations:

      - 1024x1024 (default)

      - 1152x896

      - 896x1152

      - 1216x832

      - 1344x768

      - 768x1344

      - 1536x640

      - 640x1536 


      ### SDXL 1.0 Pricing

      When specifying 30 steps or fewer, generation costs 0.9 credits.


      When specifying above 30 steps, generation cost is determiend using the
      following formula:

       `cost = 0.9 * (steps / 30)`

      ### Using SD 1.6

      SD1.6 is a flexible-resolution base model allowing you to generate
      non-standard aspect ratios. The model is optimized for a resolution of 512
      x 512 pixels. To generate 1 megapixel outputs, we recommend using SDXL
      1.0, which is available at the same price.


      Pass in `stable-diffusion-v1-6` as the `engine_id` of your request and
      ensure the `height` & `width` you pass in adhere to the following
      restrictions:

      - No dimension can be less than 320 pixels

      - No dimension can be greater than 1536 pixels

      - Height and width must be specified in increments of 64

      - The default resolution is 512 x 512
